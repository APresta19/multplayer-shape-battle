Multiplayer Shape Battle is a 2-player game where you must fight each other to knock the opposing player off the map into the spikes. Players can choose between a circle, square, triangle, and star.

Player 1 must use "1", "2", "3", and "4" to choose their shape.
Player 2 must either use "7", "8", "9", and "0" or "1", "2", "3", and "4" on the right num pad to choose their shape.

Player 1 can move around with WASD and jump (or fire with triangle and star) by pressing space.
Player 2 can move around with the arrow keys and jump by pressing the up arrow. To fire with p2, you must press right shift.

Each shape has unique abilities some with an additional ability to go with it:

Circle is good all around and can dash by pressing shift (Left shift for p1, right shight for p2)

Square is the heaviest shape and uses it's mass to slam opponents into obstacles nearby. The higher the square jumps, the more force it gives to it's opponents.

Triangle can fly around the map and shoots singular heavy bullets to knock players off the map.

Star can fly arounnd the map and shoots multiple light bullets to knock players off the map.

There are many unique maps with obstacles that offer different interactions depending on the shape.
There are also two powerups: speed and size. A blue powerup is a speed powerup that makes you faster, allowing you to get around quicker and create a stronger force on your hits. A pink powerup is a size powerup that makes you bigger, allowing you to use your large mass to overpower your opponent. Furthermore, a size powerup will increase the size and knockback on the triangle and star's bullets.
